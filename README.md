# store-sales-ts-forecasting
The goal of the project is to forecast unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores - a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. Data comes from [Corporaci√≥n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting) from Kaggle.
The training data includes dates, store and item information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the unit sales. Additional files include supplementary information that may be useful in building your models.
